<h4> Help </h4>
<p>
	Welcome to SNES A.D.  You can either use the built-in ROM downloader to get games or you may place your unzipped ROM images to:
</p>
<h5> /var/mobile/Media/ROMs/SNES/ </h5>
<p>While in game you can save, load, and go back to the main menu. Press the 'S' bubble to save your game in the current save slot and the 'L' bubble to load it. Press the 'Menu' button at the top of the screen to return to the menu.
</p>

<h4> Wiimote </h4>
<p>To use the wiimote feature, select on in settings and follow the ensuing instructions. The wiimote is designed to be played holding it horizontally, controls are as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr class='bold'><td>Wiimote</td><td>SNES A.D.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>(+)</td><td>Start</td></tr>
<tr><td>(-)</td><td>Select</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>Y</td></tr>
<tr><td>Home</td><td>menu</td></tr>
</table>


<p>
	SNES A.D. supports a Wii Classic controller as well.  The controls mimic that of the SNES A.D. controls. Exceptions being save/load which are the left and right inner bumpers labeled (ZL/ZR).
</p>
<p>If playing with wiimote and for any reason the controller connection is lost, either resume play with on screen controllers by disabling wiimote in settings or exit out of the app and re-sync your controller. (in order to not lose your place in-game, remember to save).
</p>

<h4> Achievements </h4>
<p>SNES A.D. features an achievements system for added replay value. Enable achievements in the options menu to attain achievements. You can see your individual achievements by navigating to the achievements menu.
</p>
<p> In addition to global achievements, there are hi-scores and game specific achievement packs. There currently are around 5-10 games which support hi scores and achievements. As you complete achievements, you will earn coins which can be used to purchase additional packs online. Each pack has roughly enough coins possible to buy two additional packs. SNES A.D. comes with the Legend of Zelda achievement pack by default. </p>
<p> There will be a notice every time you play a game that supports achievements or hi scores. It is best to choose the verified US ( (U) [!] ) version of the ROM if you can find it as most of the achievements were targeted towards that. European, verified good dump ROMs are also likely to work ( (E) [!] ).
</p>
<p>
	You may unlock your acquired achievements and stats by syncing with bslapps.com inside the info button under the achievements menu.
</p>
<h4> Betas </h4>
<p> Beta achievements are those which have not been fully tested and verified as working. You will get an additional 50 coins for every beta pack you get as well as a global achievement marking this. You can help bslapps out by getting beta packs and telling us which achievements work and which dont. 
</p>
<h4> Downloading ROMS </h4>
<p> SNES A.D. comes with a built-in ROM downloader that you can use to download ROMs for game which you already own. If the activity spinner on the top status bar is spinning, it indicates either a page is loading or a ROM is downloading. </p>
<h4> Profile </h4>
<p> There is also a profile system that features ranks, levels, and bucks. Every hour of gameplay earns you a bslapp buck. Every time you level up, you will gain additional bucks. These bucks can be used to purchase non-game specific items such as avatars or badges. </p>
<h4> IPS Patching </h4>
<p> SNES A.D. supports automatic IPS patching as long as the name of the ips file is the same as the ROM name (not including the extension). IPS files should have a ".ips" extension. </p>
<h4> Issues </h4>
<p>If SNES A.D. is running slowly for you, you can disable transparency and sound. Disabling transparency may affect some games graphically however.</p>
